# Controversy Solver

[My Notes](notes.md)

A brief description of the application here.

> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

How many times have you argued with your friends over simple controversial subjects, such as whether water is wet, cereal is a soup, or what utensil you eat macaroni and cheese with? This website can finally settle some of the most controversial debates through a simple voting system. Whichever choice receives the most votes determines what option is truly correct. The website even lets you see how popular each option is among other people, and will notify you when a winner has changed.

### Design

Here is how people would interact with the website. In this case, User1 tipped the scale of votes and now the option 'Fork' is winning.

    User1->>Website: Voted for Fork
    Website->>User2: Fork is Winning
    Website->>User3: Fork is Winning
```

### Key features

- Prevents votes until signed in
- Shows total vote count for each option after submitting votes
- Displays images for each option
- Only allows one vote per user
- Votes stay permantly 
- Displays winning option when winner changes
- Highlights winning option after submitting votes

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses two pages, one fpr voting and one for displaying the results.
- **CSS** - Text for options is centered under each image, looks nice, and is easy to read. Easy to determine which option is winning on results page.
- **React** - Redirects user to results page when votes are submittied via a button press.
- **Service** - Uses authentication API to verify user is logged in and hasn't already voted
- **DB/Login** - Displays the amount of votes made for each option o nthe results page.
- **WebSocket** - Notifies user if a new option receives more votes than current winner.
